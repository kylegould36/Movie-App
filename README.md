# Movie App Project

<p>Here is my first react project! It is a movie app that allows you to search movies by name. You can add movies you look up to a favorites list. If you want to change your favorites list, you can remove movies from it if needed. Your favorites list will save to your local storage! You won't have to worry about losing your list! The layout is similar to what Netflix would look like for easy use.</p>
